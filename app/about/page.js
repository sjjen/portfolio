        I'm a queer developer and designer born in Seoul, South Korea &
        currently based out of Portland, OR. <br />
        Coming from a creative background, I really enjoy building
        well-functioning <br />
        full-stack applications with beautiful, clean UI.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my free time, I enjoy working on little side projects, <br />
        such as this website, which I'm utilizing as a virtual playground for
        myself.
        <br />
        Additionally, I love doing yoga, going on walks, hanging out at the
        beach or parks, attending live shows,
        <br />
        and spending time petting stray cats or strangers' dogs. My interests in
        creative hobbies range
        <br />
        from painting to knitting to woodworking and beyondâ€”the list is endless!
        <br />
