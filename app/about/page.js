        <p>
          I&apos;m a queer developer and designer born in Seoul, South Korea &
          currently based out of Portland, OR. <br />
          Coming from a creative background, I really enjoy building
          well-functioning <br />
          full-stack applications with beautiful, clean UI.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my free time, I enjoy working on little side projects, <br />
          such as this website, which I&apos;m utilizing as a virtual playground for
          myself.
          <br />
          Additionally, I love doing yoga, going on walks, hanging out at the
          beach or parks, attending live shows,
          <br />
          and spending time petting stray cats or strangers&apos; dogs. My interests in
          creative hobbies range
          <br />
          from painting to knitting to woodworking and beyondâ€”the list is endless!
          <br />
          <br />
          This site is serving as a creative outlet for me to experiment while being able to showcase my work.<br />
          I am constantly evolving as a developer, so I&apos;m sure this project will continue to evolve alongside my growth.<br />
          The website was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with Next.js & hosted on Vercel.<br />
        </p>
        
        I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating this website!<br />
