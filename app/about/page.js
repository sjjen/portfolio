          I&apos;m a queer developer and designer born in Seoul, South Korea &
          currently based out of Portland, OR. 
          Coming from a creative background, I really enjoy building
          well-functioning 
          full-stack applications with beautiful, clean UI.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my free time, I enjoy working on little side projects, 
          such as this website, which I&apos;m utilizing as a virtual playground for
          myself.
          Additionally, I love doing yoga, going on walks, hanging out at the
          beach or parks, attending live shows,
          and spending time petting stray cats or strangers&apos; dogs. My interests in
          creative hobbies range from painting to knitting to woodworking and beyondâ€”the list is endless!
          <br />
          <br />
          This site is serving as a creative outlet for me to experiment while being able to showcase my work. (also currently a work in progress)
          I am constantly evolving as a developer, so I&apos;m sure this project will continue to evolve alongside my growth.
          The website was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with Next.js & hosted on Vercel.
          <br />
          <br />
          I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating this website!
